# Python SDK Rules

## Folder Structure

The `/python` directory should be organized as follows:

```
python/
├── src/                 # Python source code (package structure)
├── tests/               # Python test files
├── setup.py             # Python setup file (or pyproject.toml)
└── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
```

## Coding Standards

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use snake_case for function and variable names
- Use PascalCase for class names
- Organize as a proper Python package with `__init__.py` files
- Include type hints for function signatures
- Include docstrings for all public classes and functions
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## Package Structure

- Create a proper Python package structure with `__init__.py` files
- Group related functionality into modules
- Keep the package structure flat and intuitive

## Testing

- Write unit tests for all new features
- Use pytest or unittest framework
- Keep test files in `tests/` directory
- Name test files with `test_` prefix

## Dependencies

- List all dependencies in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`
- Pin versions for production dependencies
- Keep dependencies minimal and well-documented
