# Swift SDK Rules

## Folder Structure

The `/swift` directory should be organized as follows:

```
swift/
├── Sources/             # Swift source code
├── Tests/               # Swift test files
└── Package.swift        # Swift Package Manager manifest
```

## Coding Standards

- Follow Swift naming conventions:
  - PascalCase for types (classes, structs, enums, protocols)
  - camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Organize files by feature/module
- Keep test files parallel to source files
- Use access control modifiers appropriately (`public`, `internal`, `private`)
- Prefer `struct` over `class` when possible
- Use `Codable` for API response models
- Support async/await for iOS 15+ where applicable

## Package Structure

- All source files go in `Sources/VillaEcommerceSdk/`
- All test files go in `Tests/VillaEcommerceSdkTests/`
- Maintain proper module organization

## Testing

- Write unit tests for all public APIs
- Use XCTest framework
- Follow naming convention: `testFunctionName()`
- Keep tests organized and maintainable
